# SleepSync - Are You a Morning Lark or a Night Owl?
A machine learning-powered web application that predicts a user's natural chronotype (morning person or night person) based on their daily habits and preferences.

# Project Overview
SleepSync features an interactive quiz that collects information about users' sleep patterns and energy levels throughout the day. The application uses a machine learning model to classify users as "Morning Larks" or "Night Owls." What makes SleepSync unique is its interactive feedback loopâ€”users can vote on the accuracy of their prediction, and this data is used to retrain and improve the machine learning model periodically.
