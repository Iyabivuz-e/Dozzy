Step 3: Feature Engineering
Once the data is clean, modify or create new features to improve model performance.

    ##3.1 Encode Categorical Variables
    ##The chronotype column (Morning Lark/Night Owl) needs to be converted into a numerical format.
    Options:
    ##Label Encoding (Morning Lark â†’ 0, Night Owl â†’ 1).
    ##One-Hot Encoding (if there are multiple categories in a dataset).##

    3.2 Normalize or Scale Data (if needed)
    Some models (like Neural Networks and SVMs) perform better when numerical features are scaled.
    Survey responses (q1 to q7) might need scaling (e.g., Min-Max Scaling) if their ranges are inconsistent.

    ##3.3 Remove Unnecessary Columns##
    ##The timestamp and id columns are not useful for training and should be removed.##
    ##The confidence column might also be removed unless it's used as a feature.##

Step 4: Splitting the Data
    4.1 Train-Test Split
    Divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.
    Ensure both classes (Morning Larks and Night Owls) are represented proportionally in both sets.
    4.2 Consider Cross-Validation
    If the dataset is small, use k-fold cross-validation instead of a simple train-test split for better model performance estimation.
    Final Check Before Moving to Model Training
5.1 Verify Data Quality
    Make sure there are no missing values after preprocessing.
    Confirm that all features are in the right format (numerical, categorical).
    Check that the dataset is well-balanced.
    5.2 Save the Processed Data
    Save the cleaned dataset to a new file (processed_data.csv) so it can be used for modeling.
    Next Steps:
    Once these steps are completed, youâ€™ll be ready to move on to model selection and training (which is the next major phase in the machine learning pipeline).
